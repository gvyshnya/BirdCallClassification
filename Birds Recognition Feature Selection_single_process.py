# # Preface
# 
# We will inherit the feature engineering effort from
# https://www.kaggle.com/andradaolteanu/birdcall-recognition-eda-and-audio-fe and
# https://www.kaggle.com/parulpandey/eda-and-audio-processing-with-python to generate the set of features.
# 
# Then we will apply the analytical feature selection methods against a *lightgbm* modeller to see which features
# would work the best from a *lightgbm* stand-point.
